(Above, a Google Street View of I-95’s bridge to nowhere.)

There cannot be a more baffling exit on I-95 in Miami-Dade County. As described by reporter Tristram Korten from the road:

{% blockquote %}
I’m driving north on 95, I see this exit for Miami Beach. I think, “great that’s were want to go.” I get on this exit, I go up in the air. I come back down. I’m back down 95! That’s not my exit for Miami Beach.
{% endblockquote %}

The actual exit, he adds, is not for another half a mile.

A few years ago Korten set out to find an explanation for Miami’s “Bridge to Nowhere.” He took a senior FDOT official along for the head-scratching ride.

"So were going on the flyover," explained Alice Bravo, then director of transportation systems development for FDOT in Miami. "We can see below a congested two-lane ramp. So we just probably crossed over at least a 3,000-vehicle-per-hour movement. But now we’re back on an identified mainline and we’re to the right of all those folks."

The flyover was completed in 1994 and cost roughly $17 million. As Korten reports, the idea behind the bridge to nowhere is to keep beach-bound traffic on the right while three different arteries merge with I-95.

"From the east: the MacArthur Causeway," writes Korten, "From the west: the Dolphin Expressway and the exit for Biscayne Boulevard."

"So you can imagine if you have 5 to 6,000 cars per hour weaving to the left," said Bravo, "with probably 2,000 vehicles per hour weaving to the right to exit Miami Beach. That’s a huge conflict point."

Here’s a [link to Tristram Korten’s entire radio piece](http://wlrn.org/post/what-s-south-florida-south-florida-s-own-bridge-nowhere) on the bridge to nowhere (including what Alice Bravo thinks of the nickname).
