Yesterday we explained how the Florida Highway Patrol has been getting flooded by complaints of [unchecked speed in the 95 Express lanes](/blog/2014/02/15/i-95-s-narrow-shoulders-and-speeding-cars-problematic-for-fhp/). (The story also ran in the [Miami Herald](http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/02/02/3909543/fhp-95-express-has-a-speeding.html) and on WLRN.)

In case there was any doubt that traffic stops occur, we present the case of Evan Benn.

Benn, the Miami Herald’s new economy reporter, tweeted us the following confession today:

{% blockquote %}
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/RadioMalone">@radiomalone</a> I&#39;m a jerk. Thought your story gave carte blanche to 95 Express speed. Got stopped. 74 in 55. Cited story. Got off w warning.</p>&mdash; Evan Benn (@EvanBenn) <a href="https://twitter.com/EvanBenn/statuses/430764941872992256">February 4, 2014</a></blockquote>

{% endblockquote %}

In the story Benn’s referring to, an FHP spokesman told us that the narrow shoulder inside the express-lanes has made enforcement difficult at best. There are but a handful of places wide enough to make a traffic stop within the actual express-lanes.

Benn told the motorcycle trooper who pulled him over that he was ashamed because he’d just read a “story about how dangerous those lanes are to patrol.”
The trooper, who apparently had also seen the story, let Benn off with a warning.

While leaving readers more informed is, of course, reward enough for The End of the Road project, it’s worth pointing out that a ticket for going 19 MPH over the speed limit would have cost Evan Benn [$269 in Miami-Dade County](http://www.miami-dadeclerk.com/service_fee_schedule.asp#traffic). Certainly he could afford to buy us a well-reviewed beer or two for being so informative.

In addition to his staff job at the Miami Herald Evan Benn is a beer columnist for Esquire.com. He is author of the book “Brew in the Lou: St. Louis’ Beer Culture, Past, Present & Future.” Tell us about your life at The End of the Road by using  #WLRN95.
