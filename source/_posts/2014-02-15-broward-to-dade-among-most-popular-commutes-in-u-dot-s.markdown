In a few of the initial stories from The End of the Road project, we’ve pointed out that living in Broward County and working in Miami-Dade County is by far the most popular county-to-county work situation in South Florida.

(We’ve also documented how commuting from Broward to Dade on I-95 is, at times, a circle of Hell so awful that even “Dante could not have conceived of [it].” So we’re using “popular” in a purely numeric sense here.)

That fact comes from the 2006-2010 American Communities Survey put out by the U.S. Census Bureau. The survey records the county where someone lives and the county where that person works. While this doesn’t necessarily translate to a “commute” by the standard, drive-to-work definition — non-Yahoo employees could be telecommuting — the survey is still one of the better ways to measure commuter culture as a whole.

Below is a table of the 100 most popular county-to-county live/work situations in the country. As it turns out, Broward-to-Miami-Dade is not only tops in South Florida but in all of Florida.

Twelve of the top 100 commutes are in Florida and four of those are in South Florida. You can click the column headers to reorganize the data as you like.
