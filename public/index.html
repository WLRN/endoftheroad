  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="https://docs.google.com/a/miamiherald.com/spreadsheet/oimg?key=0AvRZhb8YZi9WdHJlX3pWMmZYaUhhcWFZR0loRV9RWEE&oid=2&zx=95uxkn1k0t9c"></p>

<p>Snowbirding is an unavoidable pastime for year-round South Floridians. The more anecdotal leading indicators, of course, include a rise in out-of-state license plates, a disproportionate number of sunburns, a baffling spike in people asking the way to South Beach when they’re already on South Beach. (I’m partial to socks with sandals as the true bellwether.)</p>

<p>It turns out the data being reported as part of the 95 Express Project probably does a better job spotting those population spikes. The graph above shows the average weekday traffic on Miami-Dade’s stretch of I-95.
Over the last few years, three of the four most heavily trafficked months were March. While these numbers are just for Miami-Dade, the pattern apparently holds in Broward as well.</p>

<p>“March and April,” said Jeffrey Weidner, a Strategic Development Manager with FDOT District 4, “our traffic data show that those are the two big months right up to the Easter weekend.” Weidner says the 13 weeks prior to Easter weekend can produce anywhere from 5 to 20 percent higher traffic volumes.</p>

<p>March as a peak month is far from a revelation. Probably the most watched measures of tourism are the hotel occupancy rates put out by Smith Travel Research. According to STR, South Florida hotels tend to be brimming more often in March than any other month.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="http://i.imgur.com/PgYaqbs.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>7:17 a.m.:</strong> The commuter sets a kitchen timer for 13 minutes. “Okay, countdown,” she says. “T-minus…”</p>

<p>She slurps down a cup of coffee, looks wistfully at the carafe and says, “I never get around to that second cup.”</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://i.imgur.com/wY8kGfV.jpg"></p>

<p>She knows her priorities: Gas tank? Topped off last night. Lunch? Packed. Dinner? Also packed. (“I don’t know what it’s like to have dinner in my own house.”)
This is what it looks like, arming for 21st Century suburban warfare. Speed, organization and provisions in the name of a single goal: to get from Atlantic Boulevard in Broward County to Downtown Miami by 9:30 a.m. via Interstate 95.</p>

<p><strong>7:30 a.m.:</strong> The kitchen timer goes off. “Hup! Gotta go!”</p>

<p>At last count there were roughly 125,000 people like this commuter: Broward County residents with job in Miami-Dade. Broward to Dade is by far the most popular county-to-county commute in South Florida, according to the 2006-2010 American Communities Survey put out by the U.S. Census.</p>

<p>While many drivers avoid I-95 at all costs, many clearly do not.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/lLVhQHtGaz4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p><strong>7:47 a.m.:</strong> The commuter turns towards the 95 on-ramp from Atlantic Boulevard. “This is where I keep my fingers crossed,” she says.</p>

<p>Today, at this hour, she joins 6,475 fellow drivers along her commute, according to the international traffic analysis company INRIX.</p>

<p>The commuter concedes, so far so good.</p>

<p><strong>8:00 a.m.:</strong> With her thumbnail, she tunes her radio to 91.3 FM, WLRN.</p>

<p>She chuckles.</p>

<p>“Now I ask you,” says the commuter, “isn’t that a beautiful voice? I could listen to her all day long.”</p>

<p><strong>8:33 a.m.:</strong> Just north of the 103rd Street exit, the commuter approaches a slightly elevated section of I-95 — just enough of a hill to block the view ahead.</p>

<p>“It’s like a battle plan, it’s like going to war,” she says. “You know, military strategists talk in terms of hills. I’ve got to take that hill.”</p>

<p>Ever superstitious, she refuses to admit that things have been going well. She passed her personal litmus test: clearing the Broward County line in less than 30 minutes.</p>

<p>And as she heads towards this little hill, she’s driving at least 55 MPH with just more than five miles left on I-95.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” she says as she clears the hill, “This is what I’m talking about!”</p>

<p>Over the hill: brake lights, inexplicably, as far as the eye can see. The commuter comes to a dead stop.</p>

<p>“Look at [the brake lights]. Red little demon eyes stopping you in your tracks. Interfering with your making a living. Look at them, they’re like little incubi — little gremlins that say, ‘You’re not going to make it, you’re not gonna make it.’”</p>

<p>Grinding to a halt with no sign of an accident or a stalled car, said Tim Lomax of the Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute, sounds like evidence of “the slinky effect” on I-95 South.</p>

<p>“Usually it starts with an entrance ramp that has a lot of volume,” explained Lomax. But then “the slowdown would start to migrate back to the north … as much as a mile or two miles so that the slowdown, after a while, it doesn’t really happen at the place where it started.”</p>

<p><strong>8:34 a.m.:</strong> As mysteriously as it stopped, traffic starts again.</p>

<p>In reality, I-95 isn’t even in South Florida’s top three most congested routes, according to INRIX. That dubious honor goes to the evening drives west on the Dolphin Expressway, south on the Palmetto Expressway and the morning commute north on the Turnpike’s Homestead extension.</p>

<p>But the unpredictability, the way 95 can dangle hope of an early arrival and then crush it in a heartbeat, thinks the commuter, is a particularly cruel breed of congestion.</p>

<p>[PDF: Texas A&amp;M TTI research: 30 years of South Florida congestion.]</p>

<p><strong>8:45 a.m.:</strong> From the far right lane the commuter realizes she’s dreadfully close to Exit 2D — her exit.</p>

<p>“Alright, now this is always fun,” she says, looking over her shoulder, “trying to convince another driver to let you in.”</p>

<p>The commuter makes her way across three lanes of traffic. She’s been on the road for about an hour and 15 minutes, a relatively fast commute for her. Still, she says, that’s about a half hour longer than this same drive would take without traffic.</p>

<p>Congestion cost South Florida commuters an average of 47 hours of excess travel time in 2011, the year of the most recent congestion report from the Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute.
“You can think of that as … wasting about six vacation days worth of time commuting,” says Tim Lomax.</p>

<p><strong>9:00 a.m.:</strong> The commuter pulls into a parking spot. With a satisfying click she turns the engine off. “Sweetest sound in the world,” she says, sliding the keys free of the ignition.</p>

<p>And today’s only Monday.</p>
