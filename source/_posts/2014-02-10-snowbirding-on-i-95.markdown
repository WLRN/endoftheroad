Snowbirding is an unavoidable pastime for year-round South Floridians. The more anecdotal leading indicators, of course, include a rise in out-of-state license plates, a disproportionate number of sunburns, a baffling spike in people asking the way to South Beach when they’re already on South Beach. (I’m partial to socks with sandals as the true bellwether.)

It turns out the data being reported as part of the 95 Express Project probably does a better job spotting those population spikes. The graph above shows the average weekday traffic on Miami-Dade’s stretch of I-95.
Over the last few years, three of the four most heavily trafficked months were March. While these numbers are just for Miami-Dade, the pattern apparently holds in Broward as well. 

“March and April,” said Jeffrey Weidner, a Strategic Development Manager with FDOT District 4, “our traffic data show that those are the two big months right up to the Easter weekend.” Weidner says the 13 weeks prior to Easter weekend can produce anywhere from 5 to 20 percent higher traffic volumes. 

March as a peak month is far from a revelation. Probably the most watched measures of tourism are the hotel occupancy rates put out by Smith Travel Research. According to STR, South Florida hotels tend to be brimming more often in March than any other month.
