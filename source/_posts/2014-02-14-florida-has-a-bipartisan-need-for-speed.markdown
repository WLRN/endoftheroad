Reports abound this week of a potential bump to Florida’s 17-year-old maximum speed limit of 70 MPH. Writes the [Orlando Sentinel](http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/os-florida-speed-limit-raised-20140116,0,1793735.story):

A bipartisan contingent of lawmakers wants to allow the state Department of Transportation more leeway to raise speed limits on mostly rural stretches of highways between cities. The goal is to improve traffic flow and safety.
The bill would allow the DOT to boost top speed limits on four-lane interstate highways from 70 mph to 75 mph. Highways with 60- and 65-mph limits could also get 5-mph boosts if the DOT deems it appropriate to improving traffic flow.

The bill passed through the state’s Senate Transportation Committee on Thursday but still needs legislative and gubernatorial approval. 

One of the bill’s sponsors, Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, said the bill is intended more for Florida’s rural stretches of highway.

There are, according to the [Tampa Bay Times](http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/state-senators-want-to-increase-floridas-speed-limit-to-75-mph/2152023), 1,472 miles of Florida interstate with a 70 MPH speed limit. “Most of those miles are in Central and North Florida on Interstate 10, I-75, Florida’s Turnpike, I-95, the Suncoast Parkway and parts of I-4,” the Times writes.

While the intent of the new bill may be to speed up traffic in between major cities, it will also give traffic engineers a chance to reevaluate limits on urban highways and possibly increase 60 and 65 MPH limits by 5 MPH.

Just recently, a stretch of I-95 in Miami-Dade was permitted a 5 MPH speed limit increase — [from 55 MPH to 60 MPH](http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/09/02/3602373/you-can-go-faster-now-on-i-95.html).

As a point of reference, the average speed of traffic in the southbound 95 Express lanes last year was 66 MPH from 7-11 PM, according to FDOT data.

That, traffic permitting, an average Express lane driver might be speeding won’t come as a surprise to anyone who’s driven on I-95 in Miami-Dade. The fact that it took until September to get the speed limit raised to 60 MPH? Perhaps more shocking.

Traffic engineers use a national standard called the 85th percentile rule to evaluate traffic flow and determine appropriate speed caps. In a report on setting speed limits, the U.S. Department of Transportation describes that metric as “the speed at which 85 percent of free-flowing traffic is traveling at or below.” The report explains:

{% blockquote %}
Setting a speed limit based on the 85th percentile speed was originally based on safety. Specifically, research at the time had shown that traveling at or around one standard deviation above the mean operating speed (which is approximately the 85th percentile speed) yields the lowest crash risk for drivers. Furthermore, crash risk increases rapidly for drivers traveling two standard deviations or more above or below the mean operating speed. Therefore, the 85th percentile speed separates acceptable speed behavior from unsafe speed behavior that disproportionately contributes to crash risk.
{% endblockquote %}

Apparently Floridians have particular opinions about how fast they could or should be driving. One of FDOT’s “Frequently Asked Questions” about speed limits is: How do I get a speed limit reviewed on a State Highway? 

The answer: If you feel there is a need to change a speed limit on a state highway, or you have further questions regarding our determination of speed limits, please contact the [District Traffic Operations Engineer](http://www.dot.state.fl.us/Trafficoperations/Contacts/Contacts-District.shtm) at your local Florida Department of Transportation office.
